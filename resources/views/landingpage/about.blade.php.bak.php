                The establishment of the Life Underwriter Club Indonesia (LUCI) originated from the Underwriter Gathering held at Michael Resort on June 18–19, 2014. The event, initiated and organized by ReINDO, successfully brought together 30 underwriters representing 32 life insurance companies. This gathering served as a strategic platform to foster collaboration and professional exchange within the industry. It culminated in the formation of LUCI as a formal professional community.

                In the course of establishing legal recognition, it was acknowledged that a similar organization—PUJI—had once existed, serving as a professional forum for life insurance underwriters in the past. Although PUJI had become dormant, its legacy remained a significant part of the industry’s history. In an effort to honor that legacy, a thorough search was conducted to reconnect with the previous leadership. Unfortunately, the majority of PUJI’s board members had passed away, with Mr. Bambang Lukito being the only surviving member.

                Recognizing the importance of preserving and continuing the spirit of professional unity and excellence, it was decided to establish a new organization under the name Peruji (Perkumpulan Underwriter Jiwa Indonesia). This new body not only carries forward the values of its predecessor but also seeks to build a stronger foundation for the future of underwriting in Indonesia. Peruji was officially recognized through the Decree of the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia No. AHU-0000572.AH.01.07.Tahun 2015.
